# Data Labeling Process

This repository contains scripts that document the process of creating the **final age labels** used in my work.

## Attribution

- script 1, 2 and 3 were obtained and adapted from [MTL-Speaker-Embeddings](https://github.com/cvqluu/MTL-Speaker-Embeddings)

## Important Notes

- The scripts illustrate the **steps and logic** applied during labeling.
- Some intermediate steps may have been lost.
- Running all scripts in sequence **will not necessarily reproduce** the final results exactly.
- Instead, the code is provided as a reference to give a **general understanding** of how the data was processed and labeled.

## Dataset Information

The experiments are based on the **SCOTUS dataset**, which is publicly available with the help of the [Oyez-Project](https://www.oyez.org/about/).

Feel free to explore the scripts for inspiration, adaptation, or further research.
