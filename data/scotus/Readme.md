# Data Labeling Process

This repository contains scripts that document the process of creating the **final age labels** used in my work.

## Attribution

- script 1, 2 and 3 were obtained and adapted from: https://github.com/hechmik/voxceleb_enrichment_age_gender/blob/main/README.md

## Important Notes

- The scripts illustrate the **steps and logic** applied during labeling.
- Some intermediate steps may have been lost.
- Running all scripts in sequence **will not necessarily reproduce** the final results exactly.
- Instead, the code is provided as a reference to give a **general understanding** of how the data was processed and labeled.

## Dataset Information

The experiments are based on the **[SCOTUS dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/)**, which is publicly available.

- **Gender** and **nationality** labels were already included in the dataset.
- **Profession** and refined **nationality** labels were created following the procedure outlined in the scripts.

Feel free to explore the scripts for inspiration, adaptation, or further research.
